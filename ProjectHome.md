# Introduction #

The aim of this project is to create a NetBeans module with a simple JCR client. The project is currently in early POC stage.

# Features #

Main features:
  * simple UI for accessing and browsing JCR repositories (leveraging NB Nodes API to display JCR nodes)
  * manage multiple JCR connections (UI should look like the database connections in NetBeans IDE)
  * search capability

Compatibility:
  * Apache Jackrabbit over RMI
  * eXoJCR over RMI (planned)
